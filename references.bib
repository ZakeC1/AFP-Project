abstract="Game Theory (GT) is the formal study of conflict and cooperation among several agents, denoted as players, representing individuals, animals, computers, groups, firms, etc. The concepts of game theory provide a mathematical framework to formulate, structure, analyze, and understand such game scenarios, i.e., it provides useful mathematical models and tools to understand the possible strategies that agents may follow when competing or collaborating in games. The list of games to apply game theory is almost endless: entertaining games, political scenarios, competitions among firms, geopolitical issues between countries, and so on. This branch of applied mathematics is used nowadays in disciplines like economics, social sciences, biology, political science, international relations, computer science and philosophy among others.",
